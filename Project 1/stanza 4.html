        <h1>Meaning</h1>

            The fourth stanza of "Still I Rise" takes a more introspective turn, exploring the potential impact of the speaker's rise on her oppressor.<br>
             It opens with a series of rhetorical questions: "Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes?" <br>
             She imagines the oppressor's desire to witness her defeat, her spirit crushed and her gaze lowered in submission.<br>
              By posing these questions, she exposes their underlying motivations and challenges their expectations. The final line,<br>
               "Weakened by my soulful cries?" further emphasizes the vulnerability they might wish to see. <br>
               However, the stanza ends without answers, leaving the oppressor's desires hanging. <br>
               This deliberate ambiguity underscores the speaker's unwavering strength and resilience. <br>
               Even if her struggles and pain ("soulful cries") are acknowledged, they haven't broken her spirit.<br>
                Ultimately, the stanza serves as a powerful act of resistance by refusing to let the oppressor define her narrative or dictate her worth.
