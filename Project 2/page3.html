                        it's a room pitch black
but words on the wall glow
telling me all that I lack
but I won't let the tears flow
for crying is insanity,
don't you value your masculinity?

I don't like these walls,
they tell me to be a man,
I don't think I can,
but they stand so tall.
call me a freak,
but I swear these walls speak.
and I hate every word they utter,
they mock my stutter.

the walls that were supposed to be home,
feel like prison,
due to rules set without reason,
and I will never understand why?
but I have accepted that,
BIG BOYS DON'T CRY
