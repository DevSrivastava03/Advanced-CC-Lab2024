                        The picture talks about loneliness, the empty chair talks about being lonely even in a city like New York. New York is a city of bright yellow lights which makes it seem perfect when we land here but the loneliness which comes with it hits us when we sit in that empty chair away from home. The empty chair symbolizes the friends, family which we have left behind to create something magnanimous in this city of bright yellow lights. Itâ€™s these chairs of the small coffee shop that makes us feel this emotion everyday till we take that deep breath to restart this long journey in a crowded city like New York.
